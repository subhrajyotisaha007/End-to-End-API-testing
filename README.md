# END TO END API TESTING

In this project I did a full API testing with Python. Main purpose was the project was that we have a directory is everything there working as expected or not. for windows app it's like connectors. So if I have the API I can directly do the changes in the directory IF I have the OAuth access. I also driven the data with SQL from a database and I use the Mysql connector to connect the SQL with Python. My target was that to write a script that can be so dynamic anyone can use that. all is connected if you need to change the query then you can do it and all the code will be same. It will be same also if you change the Database, columns shiuld be same though. I also use the data to make a JSON file that can be easily handle by the API. Mainly 2 main purpose of the project -

	1. Adding Books,
	2. Updating Books if needed,
	3. Verifying all the ISBNs are unique,
	4. Try to search the book with Book ID,
	5. The book_iD should be a combination of ISBN and Aisle,
